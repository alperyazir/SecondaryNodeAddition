### Build
- Clone the repository or download.
``` 
    git clone https://github.com/alperyazir/SecondaryNodeAddition.git

`QT+= network` 

- Executables are in the same directory in SecondaryNodeAddition/builds... directory.

### Usage
- **MN** is main server. It starts two servers for SN and UE. 
SN port is defined `6666`
UE port is defined `6626`
Ports can be changable in MN>MainWindows.cpp constructor.

- **SN** and **UE** connect the MN as clients with connect button and hostname and port parameters.
- When connections are done, **Start SNA** button on MN's UI is going to be enable to start procedure.

- Messages can be observed on status window for all processes with the time stamps. So, messages order can be trackable corresponding the precedure.
- Colors on the status windows:
    * <span style="color:blue">Blue</span>: Status color
